# Vehicle-Tracking-System-Using-GPS-GSM-Modules-And-Arduino-IDE



The vehicle tracking system incorporates the hardware part that is the Arduino, GPS and GSM modules kept inside the vehicle that is to be tracked. The unit is mainly based on a module that receives signalsfrom the satellite with the help of GPS antenna. This module then converts the data and sends the vehicle location information via SMS.

For Software side we have used Arduino code written in Arduino IDE and it's Tiny GPS Library and to locate the location on map we use Google map API.

Hardware Components:
1. Arduino UNO
2. GPS - Neo 6m GPS Module
3. GSM - SIM800C Module
4. 3.7V Lithium Battery
